### Hey, there! 👋🏼

I'm Andrei — programmer, maths enthusiast, and a bit of a geek.

I absolutely love C# and most things .NET.
I'd also really like to start learning some Rust, TypeScript, and Julia one day.

Besides this, I'm interested in performance optimization, quantum computing,
cybersecurity & privacy, video games, geopolitics,
sports — especially tennis — and just knowledge, in general.

I'm also keen on contributing more to open source projects.
As a side note, my PC runs on [Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org) —
if you're looking for an amazing Linux distro, you should give it a try!

### What else?

Have a look at [my gists](https://gist.github.com/abalaci),
maybe you'll find something useful there.
