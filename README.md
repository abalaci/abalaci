### Hey, there! 👋🏼

I'm Andrei, a software engineer and somewhat of a geek.

I absolutely love C# and all things .NET - well, to be fair, maybe not all of them!

I'd really like to start learning some Rust, TypeScript, and Julia one day.
Besides this, I'm also interested in quantum computing, maths, cybersecurity & privacy,
video games (Mass Effect is good, Mass Effect is great!), and tennis - long live King Roger, first of his name!

I'm also keen on contributing more to open source projects.
As a side note, my PC runs on [Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org) - if you're looking for an amazing Linux distro,
you should definitely give it a try!

### What else?

Have a look at [my gists](https://gist.github.com/abalaci), maybe you'll find something useful there.
